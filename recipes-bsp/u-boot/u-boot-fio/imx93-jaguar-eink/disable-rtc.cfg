# Comprehensive RTC disable for imx93-jaguar-eink
# Separate RTC chip will be implemented - PCF2131 not needed
# This fixes both driver dependencies AND command dependencies

# === Disable RTC Drivers ===
# PCF2131 RTC driver (main culprit)
CONFIG_RTC_PCF2131=n

# Other I2C-dependent RTC drivers
CONFIG_RTC_PCF2127=n
CONFIG_RTC_PCF8563=n
CONFIG_RTC_DS1307=n
CONFIG_RTC_DS3231=n

# === Disable RTC Command Support ===
# This fixes the cmd/date.c undefined reference errors
CONFIG_CMD_DATE=n

# === Disable DM RTC Framework ===
# Disable the entire RTC framework to eliminate all dependencies
CONFIG_DM_RTC=n

# === Keep Basic Time Support ===
# Keep basic time functions but without RTC hardware dependency
# CONFIG_SYS_RTC_BUS_NUM is not set
# CONFIG_RTC_ENABLE_32KHZ_OUTPUT is not set

# CONFIRMED: Separate RTC chip will be implemented for imx93-jaguar-eink
# PCF2131 is not needed and causes I2C dependency issues with SPL optimization
# Time management handled via network/GPS until separate RTC implementation
