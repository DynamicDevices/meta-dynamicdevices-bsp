# Disable PCF2131 RTC driver to resolve I2C dependency
# The PCF2131 RTC driver requires I2C functions that we disabled for SPL size optimization
# For battery-powered E-Ink board, system time can be managed by other means

# Disable PCF2131 RTC driver

# Disable other RTC drivers that might have I2C dependencies
CONFIG_RTC_PCF2127=n

# Keep basic RTC support but without I2C-dependent drivers
# CONFIG_DM_RTC=y (keep for basic RTC functionality)
