# Disable Ethernet support in U-Boot for imx93-jaguar-eink
# The E-Ink board uses WiFi (handled by kernel), not Ethernet
# This eliminates ~0.5s of network initialization time during U-Boot

# Disable FEC Ethernet controller (the main source of delays)
# CONFIG_FEC_MXC is not set
CONFIG_FEC_MXC=n

# Disable MII commands (Ethernet PHY management)
# CONFIG_CMD_MII is not set
CONFIG_CMD_MII=n

# Disable fastboot command (depends on networking and not needed for E-Ink board)
# CONFIG_CMD_FASTBOOT is not set
CONFIG_CMD_FASTBOOT=n

# Keep minimal networking support for potential USB fastboot/other tools
# but disable the physical Ethernet interface that causes delays

# This eliminates the following boot messages and delays:
# - "Net: Could not get PHY for FEC0: addr 2" (repeated)
# - "Warning: ethernet@428a0000 (eth1) using random MAC address"
# - Network device enumeration and initialization time
# - Fastboot command that depends on net_loop
#
# Expected savings: ~0.5 seconds during U-Boot initialization
# Impact: None - kernel handles WiFi networking independently
# Note: Keeps core networking for USB fastboot if needed in future
