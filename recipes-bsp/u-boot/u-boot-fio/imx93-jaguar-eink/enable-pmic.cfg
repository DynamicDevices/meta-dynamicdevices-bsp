# Enable comprehensive PCA9451A PMIC support for i.MX93 Jaguar E-Ink
# Ensures proper voltage regulation for LPM driver and power management
# NOTE: SPL support disabled to prevent SRAM overflow (SPL size limit exceeded)

# Device Model PMIC Framework (U-Boot only)
CONFIG_DM_PMIC=y
# CONFIG_SPL_DM_PMIC is not set

# PCA9451A PMIC Driver Support (U-Boot only)
CONFIG_DM_PMIC_PCA9450=y
# CONFIG_SPL_DM_PMIC_PCA9450 is not set

# PCA9451A Regulator Support (U-Boot only - CRITICAL for voltage scaling)
CONFIG_DM_REGULATOR_PCA9450=y
# CONFIG_SPL_DM_REGULATOR_PCA9450 is not set

# I2C support (U-Boot only to save SPL space)
CONFIG_DM_I2C=y
# CONFIG_SPL_DM_I2C is not set

# Power management commands for debugging (U-Boot only)
CONFIG_CMD_PMIC=y
CONFIG_CMD_REGULATOR=y

# This enables:
# - PCA9451A PMIC detection and initialization in U-Boot (not SPL)
# - BUCK1-6 and LDO1/4/5 regulator support in U-Boot
# - Runtime voltage scaling support for LPM driver
# - I2C2 communication with PMIC at address 0x25 in U-Boot
# - U-Boot commands: pmic list, pmic read, regulator list, etc.
# - SPL kept minimal to fit in SRAM size constraints
