# SSH configuration for imx8mm-jaguar-sentai - Development/Testing Configuration
# This configuration enables password authentication for easier development access
# WARNING: Less secure than key-only authentication - use only for development

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# Public key authentication (preferred)
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2
# but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys

#AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none

#AuthorizedKeysCommand none

# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

# HostbasedAuthentication

# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files

# DEVELOPMENT: Enable password authentication for easier access
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Change to yes to enable keyboard-interactive authentication (beware issues
# with some PAM modules and threads)
# FIXED: Disable keyboard-interactive to avoid PAM credential issues

#KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes
#KerberosTicketCleanup yes
#KerberosGetAFSToken no

# GSSAPI options (removed - not supported in this OpenSSH build)
#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the KbdInteractiveAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via KbdInteractiveAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and KbdInteractiveAuthentication to 'no'.
# ENABLED: Required for pam_mkhomedir to create home directory on SSH login
# PAM session processing is needed even if authentication is via keys
