# Fix SOC_IMX9 configuration conflict for imx93-jaguar-eink
# 
# The base configuration wants SOC_IMX9=y but dependency IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE=m
# forces SOC_IMX9=m. This fixes the conflict by ensuring consistent configuration.

# Make IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE built-in to allow SOC_IMX9 to be built-in
CONFIG_IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE=y

# Ensure SOC_IMX9 is built-in for better performance
CONFIG_SOC_IMX9=y
