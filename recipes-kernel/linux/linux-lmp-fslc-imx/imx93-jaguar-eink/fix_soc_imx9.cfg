# Fix SOC_IMX9 configuration conflict for imx93-jaguar-eink
# 
# Since EdgeLock Enclave is not used on E-Ink board (disabled in device tree),
# we need to disable IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE to prevent soc_imx9 from trying to access
# ELE secure element during fuse reading operations.

# Disable EdgeLock Enclave since it's not used on E-Ink board
CONFIG_IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE=n

# Keep SOC_IMX9 as module to avoid dependency conflicts
CONFIG_SOC_IMX9=m

# Disable NVMEM OCOTP FSB S400 driver that requires EdgeLock Enclave
CONFIG_NVMEM_IMX_OCOTP_FSB_S400=n
