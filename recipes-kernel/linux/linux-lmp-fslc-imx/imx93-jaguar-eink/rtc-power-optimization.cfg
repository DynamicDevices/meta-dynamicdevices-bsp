# RTC POWER OPTIMIZATION FOR 5-YEAR BATTERY LIFE - ENHANCED WITH DATASHEET ANALYSIS
# ============================================================================
# 
# VERIFIED POWER CONSUMPTION (PCF2131 Datasheet Analysis):
# - Internal i.MX93 RTC: ~100µA (UNACCEPTABLE for 5-year battery life)
# - External PCF2131 RTC: 83-104 nA @ 3.3V (BETTER than 600nA spec!)
# - MCXC143VFM PMU RTC: Always powered (internal to PMU)
#
# ACTUAL POWER IMPROVEMENT: 100µA → 83nA = 1,205x improvement!
# ANNUAL SAVINGS: ~876 mAh/year from RTC optimization
#
# STRATEGY:
# - PRIMARY: Use PCF2131 (83-104nA) for timekeeping and wake
# - DISABLE: All high-power internal RTCs (~100µA savings)
# - OPTIMIZE: PCF2131 configuration for minimum power consumption
# - ENABLE: Wake sources and time synchronization
#
# HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:
# - PCF2131 INTA# → GPIO4_IO22 (i.MX93 wake)
# - PCF2131 INTB# → PTC5/LLWU_P9 (PMU wake)

# PCF2131 ADVANCED POWER OPTIMIZATIONS (From Datasheet Analysis)
# ============================================================================
#
# POWER MANAGEMENT MODES (PWRMNG[2:0]):
# - 000: Standard mode (default) - Higher power due to VDD monitoring
# - 011: Direct switching mode - LOWER POWER (no VDD/Vth monitoring)
# 
# TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION:
# - TC_DIS = 0: Temperature compensation enabled (default, higher power)
# - TC_DIS = 1: Temperature compensation disabled (ULTRA-LOW POWER)
#   Trade-off: ±3ppm accuracy vs ±1ppm (acceptable for E-Ink timing)
#
# BATTERY OPTIMIZATION:
# - VBAT = 3.3V: 83-104 nA (optimal for our battery configuration)
# - Battery low detection: Enabled for maintenance alerts
# - Dual interrupt mode: INTA (i.MX93) + INTB (PMU) wake paths
#
# EXPECTED RESULTS:
# - Current: 83-104 nA (better than 600nA specification!)
# - Power improvement: 100µA → 83nA = 1,205x better
# - Annual savings: ~876 mAh/year
# - 5-year battery life: ACHIEVABLE with this optimization
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# OPERATIONAL STRATEGY NOTES:
# ============================================================================
# 1. i.MX93 uses PCF2131 for primary timekeeping (always accurate)
# 2. PCF2131 configured in direct switching mode (lower power)
# 3. Temperature compensation disabled for ultra-low power
# 4. i.MX93 syncs time with PMU periodically when powered
# 5. i.MX93 sets wake schedules in PMU before sleep
# 6. PMU uses internal RTC or PCF2131 INTB# to wake i.MX93
# 7. Complete i.MX93 power-down possible while maintaining time/wake
#
# POWER SAVINGS SUMMARY:
# - Disable ~100µA internal RTC consumption
# - Use 83-104nA PCF2131 for timekeeping (1,205x improvement!)
# - Enable complete i.MX93 power shutdown
# - Total RTC power: 83nA vs 100µA (1,205x improvement!)
# - Annual energy savings: ~876 mAh/year
