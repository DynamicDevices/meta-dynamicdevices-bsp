7 Functional description
The PCF2131 is an RTC and calendar with an on-chip Temperature Compensated Crystal (Xtal) Oscillator
(TCXO) and a 32.768 kHz quartz crystal integrated into the same package.

Address and data are transferred by a selectable 400 kHz Fast-mode I C-bus or a 4-line SPI-bus with separate
data input and output (see Section 7.15). The maximum speed of the SPI-bus is 6.5 Mbit/s.
The PCF2131 has a backup battery input pin and backup battery switch-over circuit which monitors the main
power supply. The backup battery switch-over circuit automatically switches to the backup battery when a power
failure condition is detected (see Section 7.5.1). Accurate timekeeping is maintained even when the main power
supply is interrupted.
A battery low detection circuit monitors the status of the battery (see Section 7.5.2). When the battery voltage
drops below a certain threshold value, a flag is set to indicate that the battery must be replaced soon. This
ensures the integrity of the data during periods of battery backup.

7.1 Register overview
The PCF2131 contains an auto-incrementing address register: the built-in address register increments
automatically after each read or write of a data byte up to the register 36h. After register 36h, the autoincrementing wraps around to address 00h (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Handling address registers

• The first five registers (memory address 00h, 01h, 02h, 03h, and 04h) are used as control registers (see
Section 7.2).
• The register at address 05h is for software reset.
• The memory addresses 06h through to 0Dh are used as counters for the clock function (1/100 seconds
up to years). The date is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections
for leap years. The clock can operate in 12-hour mode with an AM/PM indication or in 24-hour mode (see
Section 7.9).
• The registers at addresses 0Eh through 12h define the alarm function. It can be selected that an interrupt is
generated when an alarm event occurs (see Section 7.10).

Nano-Power Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Quartz Crystal
• The register at address 13h defines the temperature measurement period and the clock out mode. The
temperature measurement can be selected from every 32 minutes (default) down to every 4 minutes (see
Table 17). CLKOUT frequencies of 32.768 kHz (default) down to 1 Hz for use as system clock, microcontroller
clock, and so on, can be chosen (see Table 18).
• The registers at addresses 14h to 2Fh are used for the timestamp function. When the trigger event happens,
the actual time is saved in the timestamp registers (see Section 7.12).
• The register at address 30h is used for the correction of the crystal aging effect (see Section 7.4.1).
• The registers at addresses 31h to 34h are used for interrupt configuration.
• The registers at addresses 35h and 36h are used for the watchdog timer functions. The watchdog timer has
four selectable source clocks allowing for timer periods from less than 20 ms to greater than 4 hours (see
Table 59). An interrupt is generated when the watchdog times out.
• The registers 100th Seconds, Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, and Years are all coded in Binary
Coded Decimal (BCD) format to simplify application use. Other registers are either bitwise or standard binary.
When one of the RTC registers is written or read, the content of all counters is temporarily frozen, all registers
2
hold their state during SPI or I C transactions. The time stamp registers would update once the bus transaction
completes. This prevents a faulty writing or reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition (see
Section 7.9.9).

Section 7.3.3

Programming this bit to 1 may lead to a decrease of timing accuracy.

7.3.1 Temperature compensated RTC
The frequency of tuning fork quartz crystal oscillators is temperature-dependent. In the PCF2131, the frequency
deviation caused by temperature variation is corrected by adjusting the RTC frequency divider with digital
method.
The load capacitance is trimmed to the required value at 25 °C to compensate the frequency deviation over
process variation.
The frequency accuracy at 25 °C can be evaluated by measuring the frequency of the square wave signal
available at the output pin CLKOUT. However, the selection of fCLKOUT = 32.768 kHz (default value) can lead
to inaccurate measurements. Accurate frequency measurement occurs when fCLKOUT = 16.384 kHz or lower is
selected (see Table 18).
The temperature compensated frequency input for the RTC cannot be observed at the CLKOUT pin but can be
evaluated by following these steps.
• Set the Second Interrupt and also set bit SI in register Control_1 to 1.
• Set bit TI_TP in register Watchdg_tim_ctl to 1 for a pulsed interrupt signal.
• Set bit SIA in register INTA_MASK_1 to 0 to direct the Second Interrupt to pin INTA for a 1 Hz pulse output.
The RTC temperature compensation works by adding or deleting pulses at the 32.768 kHz level. These
correction pulses are spaced evenly over a sufficiently long period of time to reach the required resolution and
accuracy. Every second corrections with a resolution of about 30.5 ppm (1/32768) can be generated by the
temperature compensation engine. If for instance a 10 ppm correction is called for, the correction pulses will be
generated approximately once every 3 seconds, for a 50 ppm correction every 0.6 s and so on.
The 1 Hz interrupt output signal can be measured with a counter and by selecting an appropriate gating time
the measurement resolution can be set to the desired level. A gating time of 100 s for instance determines the
averaged 1 second period with a resolution of 0.3 ppm.
The feature of temperature compensation can be turned off for ultra low power consumption by first performing
a software reset (SR) followed by setting TC_DIS to ‘1’ within 5 seconds.

7.3.1.1 Temperature measurement
The PCF2131 has a temperature sensor circuit used to perform temperature compensation of the clock input to
the RTC. The temperature is measured immediately after power-on and then periodically with a period set by
the temperature conversion rate TCR[1:0] in the register CLKOUT_ctl. During the first approximately 60 s after
startup, the compensation will be inactive, after this period the temperature compensation is active.

7.3.2 OTP refresh
Each IC is calibrated during production and testing of the device. The calibration parameters are stored on
EPROM cells called One Time Programmable (OTP) cells. It is recommended to process an OTP refresh once
after the power is up and the oscillator is operating stable. The OTP refresh takes less than 100 ms to complete.
To perform an OTP refresh, bit OTPR has to be cleared (set to logic 0) and then set to logic 1 again.
When read OTPR bit, its state is:
"0" until the OTP read state machine completes copying of the eFuse data into the shadow registers. This could
be due to a POR event or to writing a 0 > 1 to the OTPR register bit.
"1" when the OTP read state machine completes copying to the shadow registers from the eFuse instances.
During normal operation OTPR must be kept at 1 to prevent higher power usage.
The OTP logic is not affected by the Software Reset. The OTPR functionality is only reset by the initial digital
POR.
During OTP refresh, VDD must be above 1.8 V. The rising speed from 0 V to 1.8 V needs to be faster than 2
V/100 ms. After OTP refresh has finished, PCF2131 can operate with VDD as low as 1.2 V.

7.3.3 Clock output
A programmable square wave is available at pin CLKOUT. Operation is controlled by the COF[2:0] control bits
in register CLKOUT_ctl. Frequencies of 32.768 kHz (default) down to 1 Hz can be generated for use as system
clock, microcontroller clock, charge pump input, or for calibrating the oscillator at 25 °C to determine aging
offset. The CLKOUT output is not temperature compensated to prevent jitter due to the digital compensation
method.
CLKOUT is a push-pull output and is enabled at power-on. When disabled, the output is high-impedance.

7.5 Power management functions
The PCF2131 has two power supplies:
VDD - the main power supply
VBAT - the battery backup supply
Internally, PCF2131 operates with the internal operating voltage Voper(int) which is also available as VBBS on the
battery backed output voltage pin, BBS. Depending on the condition of the main power supply and the selected
power management function, Voper(int) is either on the potential of VDD or VBAT.
Two power management functions are implemented:
Battery switch-over function - monitors the main power supply VDD and switching to VBAT in case a power fail
condition is detected (see Section 7.5.1).
Battery low detection function - monitors the status of the battery, VBAT (see Section 7.5.2).
The power management functions are controlled by the control bits PWRMNG[2:0] (see Table 22) in register
Control_3 (see Table 10):

NXP Semiconductors

Nano-Power Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Quartz Crystal

7.5.1 Battery switch-over function
PCF2131 has a backup battery switch-over circuit which monitors the main power supply VDD. When a power
failure condition is detected, it automatically switches to the backup battery.
One of two operation modes can be selected:
Standard mode - the power failure condition happens when:
VDD < VBAT AND VDD < Vth(sw)bat
Vth(sw)bat is the battery switch threshold voltage. The typical value is 2.5 V. The battery switch-over in standard
mode works only for VDD > 2.5 V. Applying back-up battery voltage to VBAT without applying VDD supply will not
power on the device; only when VDD main power is supplied the device starts operating.
Direct switching mode - the power failure condition happens when VDD < VBAT. Direct switching from VDD to
VBAT without requiring VDD to drop below Vth(sw)bat.
When a power failure condition occurs and the power supply switches to the battery, the following sequence
occurs:
1. The battery switch flag BF (register Control_3) is set to logic 1.
2. An interrupt is generated if the control bit BIE (register Control_3) is enabled (see Section 7.13.6).
3. If the control bit BTSE (register Control_3) is logic 1, the timestamp 4 registers store the time and date when
the battery switch occurred (see Section 7.12.4).
4. The battery switch flag BF is cleared by command; it must be cleared to clear the interrupt.
The interface and CLKOUT output are disabled in battery backup operation:
• Interface inputs are not recognized, preventing extraneous data being written to the device.
• Interface outputs are high-impedance.
2

For further information about I C-bus communication and battery backup operation, see Section 7.15.3.

7.5.1.1 Standard mode
If VDD > VBAT OR VDD > Vth(sw)bat: Voper(int) is at VDD potential.
If VDD < VBAT AND VDD < Vth(sw)bat: Voper(int) is at VBAT potential.

Vth(sw)bat is the battery switch threshold voltage. The typical value is 2.5 V. In standard mode, the battery switch-over works
only for VDD > 2.5 V.
VDD may be lower than VBAT (for example VDD = 3 V, VBAT = 4.1 V).
Figure 4. Battery switch-over behavior in standard mode with bit BIE set logic 1 (enabled)

7.5.1.2 Direct switching mode
If VDD > VBAT: Voper(int) is at VDD potential.
If VDD < VBAT: Voper(int) is at VBAT potential.
The direct switching mode is useful in systems where VDD is always higher than VBAT. This mode is not
recommended if the VDD and VBAT values are similar (for example, VDD = 3.3 V, VBAT ≥ 3.0 V). In direct
switching mode, the power consumption is reduced compared to the standard mode because the monitoring of
VDD and Vth(sw)bat is not performed.

Nano-Power Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Quartz Crystal
When VBAT drops below the threshold value Vth(bat)low (typical 2.5 V), the BLF flag (register Control_3) is set to
indicate that the battery is low and that it must be replaced. Monitoring of the battery voltage also occurs during
battery operation.
An unreliable battery cannot prevent the supply voltage from dropping below Vlow (typical 1.2 V) and with that
the data integrity gets lost. (For further information about Vlow see Section 7.6.)
When VBAT drops below the threshold value Vth(bat)low, the following sequence occurs (see Figure 7):
1. The battery low flag BLF is set to logic 1.
2. An interrupt is generated if the control bit BLIE (register Control_3) is enabled (see Section 7.13.7).
3. The flag BLF remains logic 1 until the battery is replaced. BLF cannot be cleared by command. It is
automatically cleared by the battery low detection circuit when the battery is replaced or when the voltage
rises again above the threshold value. This could happen if a super capacitor is used as a backup source
and the main power is applied again.

The output pin BBS can be used as a supply for external devices with battery backup needs, such as SRAM
(see ref.[1]).

7.6 Oscillator stop detection function
The PCF2131 has an on-chip oscillator detection circuit which indicates the status of the oscillation by
monitoring the supply of oscillator: whenever the supply is out of the expected range, a reset occurs and the
Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF, in register Seconds) is set logic 1.
• Power-on:
1. The oscillator is not running and the chip is in reset (OSF is logic 1).
2. When the oscillator starts running and the supply is OK after power-on, the chip exits from reset.
3. The flag OSF is still logic 1 and can be cleared (OSF set logic 0) by command.
• Power supply failure:
1. When the power supply of the chip drops below a certain value (Vlow), typically 1.2 V, the oscillator supply
also fails and a reset occurs.
2. When the power supply returns to normal operation, the oscillator supply is OK again, the chip exits from
reset.
3. The flag OSF is still logic 1 and can be cleared (OSF set logic 0) by command.
4. When OSF flag is cleared, an OTP refresh should be performed (see Section 7.3.2).

2. The Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF), set logic 1, indicates that the oscillation has stopped and a reset has occurred since
the flag was last cleared (OSF set logic 0). In this case, the integrity of the clock information is not guaranteed. The
OSF flag is cleared by command.

7.7 Power-On Reset function
The PCF2131 has a Power-On Reset (POR) function implemented.

7.7.1 Power-On Reset (POR)
The POR is active whenever the oscillator is stopped. The oscillator is considered to be stopped during the time
between power-on and stable crystal resonance (see Figure 9). This time may be in the range of 200 ms to 2 s

also triggers CPR and CTS.
• Clear prescaler (CPR), 1010 0100 (A4h) must be sent to register Reset (address 05h).
• Clear timestamp (CTS), 0010 0101 (25h) must be sent to register Reset (address 05h).

7.8.2 CPR: clear prescaler
To set the time for RTC mode, the clear prescaler instruction is needed.
Before sending this instruction, it is mandatory to first set stop by the STOP bit.
See the STOP definition for an explanation on using this instruction.

7.8.3 CTS: clear timestamp
The timestamp registers (address 14h to 2Fh) can be set to all 0 with this instruction.

7.9 Time and date function

Figure 11. Data flow for the time function

Write access requires setting the STOP bit. The flow for accurately setting the time in RTC mode is:
• Start an I2C access at register control_1
• Set the STOP bit
• Set CPR (register SR_RESET, CPR is logic 1)
• Address counter rolls over to address 06h
• Set time (100th seconds, seconds to years)
• End I2C access
• Wait for an external time reference to indicate that time counting should start
• Start an I2C access at register control_1
• Clear STOP bit (time starts counting from now)
• End I2C access
The first increment of the time circuits is between 0 s and 122 ms after STOP is released. See description for
STOP bit in Section 7.14.
During read operations, the time counting circuits (memory locations 06h through 0Dh) are blocked. This
prevents the following:
• Faulty reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition
• Incrementing the time registers during the read cycle
After this read access is completed, the time circuit is released again. Any pending request to increment the
time counters that occurred during the read access is serviced.

Nano-Power Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Quartz Crystal
As a consequence of this method, it is important to make a read access in one go. That is, reading seconds
through to years should be made in one single access. Failing to comply with this method could result in the
time becoming corrupted.
As an example, a roll-over may occur between reads, thus giving the minutes from one moment and the hours
from the next. Therefore, it is advised to read all time and date registers in one access.

7.10 Alarm function
When one or more of the alarm bit fields are loaded with a valid second, minute, hour, day, or weekday and
its corresponding alarm enable bit (AE_x) is logic 0, then that information is compared with the actual second,

When all enabled comparisons match for the first time, the AF (register Control_2) is set. AF remains set until
cleared by command. Once AF is cleared, it is set again only when the time increments to match the alarm
condition once more. For clearing the flags, see Section 7.11.5.

7.11 Watchdog timer functions
The PCF2131 has a watchdog timer function. The timer can be switched on and off by using the control bit
WD_CD in the register Watchdg_tim_ctl.
The watchdog timer has four selectable source clocks. It can, for example, be used to detect a micro-controller
with interrupt and reset capability which is out of control (see Section 7.11.3).
To control the timer function and timer output, the registers Control_2, Watchdg_tim_ctl, and Watchdg_tim_val
are used.

7.11.3 Watchdog timer function
The watchdog timer interrupt function is enabled or disabled by the WD_CD bit of the register Watchdg_tim_ctl
(see Table 56).
The 2 bits TF[1:0] in register Watchdg_tim_ctl determine one of the four source clock frequencies for the
1
1
watchdog timer: 64 Hz, 4 Hz, ⁄4 Hz or ⁄64 Hz (see Table 59).
When the watchdog timer function is enabled, the 8-bit timer in register Watchdg_tim_val determines the
watchdog timer period (see Table 59).
The watchdog timer counts down from the software programmed 8-bit binary value n in register
Watchdg_tim_val. When the counter reaches 1, the watchdog timer flag WDTF (register Control_2) is set logic 1
and an interrupt is generated. The period accuracy corresponds to n +/- 0.5.
The register Watchdg_tim_val is write only and not readable after set.
The counter does not automatically reload.
When WD_CD is logic 1/0 (watchdog timer interrupt enabled/disabled) and the Micro-controller Unit (MCU)
loads a watchdog timer value n:
• The flag WDTF is reset
• INTA/B is cleared
• The watchdog timer starts again
Loading the counter with 0 or 1 will:
• Reset the flag WDTF
• Clear INTA/B
• Stop the watchdog timer
Remark: WDTF can be cleared by:
• Loading a value in register Watchdg_tim_val
• Writing a logic 0 to WDTF
Writing a logic 1 to WDTF has no effect.

Counter reached 1, WDTF is logic 1, and an interrupt is generated.
Figure 14. WD_CD set logic 1: watchdog activates an interrupt when timed out

• When the watchdog timer counter reaches 1, the watchdog timer flag WDTF is set logic 1.
• When a minute or second interrupt occurs, the minute/second flag MSF is set logic 1 (see Section 7.13.1).

7.11.4 Predefined timers: second and minute interrupts
PCF2131 has two predefined timers which are used to generate an interrupt either once per second or once per
minute (see Section 7.13.1). The pulse generator for the minute or second interrupt operates from an internal 64
Hz clock. It is independent of the watchdog timer. Each of these timers can be enabled by the bits SI (Second
Interrupt) and MI (Minute Interrupt) in register Control_1.

7.11.5 Clearing flags
The flags MSF and AF can be cleared by command. To prevent one flag being overwritten while clearing
another, a logic AND is performed during the write access. A flag is cleared by writing logic 0 while a flag is not
cleared by writing logic 1. Writing logic 1 results in the flag value remaining unchanged.
Two examples are given for clearing the flags. Clearing a flag is made by a write command:
• Bits labeled with - must be written with their previous values
• Bits labeled with T have to be written with logic 0
• WDTF is read only and has to be written with logic 0
Repeatedly rewriting these bits has no influence on the functional behavior.

7.12 Timestamp function
The PCF2131 has four active LOW timestamp input pins TS1, TS2, TS3, and TS4, internally pulled with on-chip
pull-up resistors to Voper(int). It also has a timestamp detection circuit which can detect the event when inputs on
pin TS1/2/3/4 are driven to ground.
The timestamp function is enabled by default after power-on and it can be switched off by setting the control bit
TSOFF (register Timestp_ctl1/2/3/4).
The time recorded in the time stamps, when in 100 Hz disable mode (1 Hz mode), is at least two 16 Hz clocks
behind the timestamp event and no more than 3 clocks behind. If the exact time of the timestamp event is
required then subtract 2 subseconds from the timestamp value and the result will have -0 subseconds to +1
subseconds of uncertainty.
A most common application of the timestamp function is described in ref.[1].
See Section 7.13.5 for a description of interrupt generation from the timestamp function.

7.12.1 Timestamp flag
When the TS1/2/3/4 input pin is driven to ground, the following sequence occurs:
1. The actual date and time are stored in the timestamp registers.
2. The timestamp flag TSF1/2/3/4 is set.
3. If the TSIE1/2/3/4 bit is active, and the corresponding interrupt mask is disabled, an interrupt on the INTA/B
pin is generated.
The TSF1/2/3/4 and TSF1/2/3/4_2 flags can be cleared by command; clearing the flag clears the interrupt.
Once TSF1/2/3/4 is cleared, it will only be set again when TS1/2/3/4 pin is driven to ground once again.

7.12.2 Timestamp mode
The timestamp function has two different modes selected by the control bit TSM (timestamp mode) in register
Timestp_ctl:
• If TSM is logic 0 (default): in subsequent trigger events without clearing the timestamp flags, the last
timestamp event is stored
• If TSM is logic 1: in subsequent trigger events without clearing the timestamp flags, the first timestamp event
is stored

• Battery low detection
The control bit TI_TP (register Watchdg_tim_ctl) is used to configure whether the interrupts generated from
the second/minute timer (flag MSF in register Control_2) are pulsed signals or a permanently active signal.
All the other interrupt sources generate a permanently active interrupt signal which follows the status of the
corresponding flags. When the interrupt sources are all disabled, INTA/B remains high-impedance.
• The flags MSF, AF, TSFx, and BF can be cleared by command.
• The flag WDTF is read only. How it can be cleared is explained in Section 7.11.5.
• The flag BLF is read only. It is cleared automatically from the battery low detection circuit when the battery is
replaced.

7.13.1 Minute and second interrupts
Minute and second interrupts are generated by predefined timers. The timers can be enabled independently
from one another by the bits MI and SI in register Control_1. However, a minute interrupt enabled on top of a
second interrupt cannot be distinguishable since it occurs at the same time.
The minute/second flag MSF (register Control_2) is set logic 1 when either the seconds or the minutes counter
increments according to the enabled interrupt (see Table 79). The MSF flag can be cleared by command.

Nano-Power Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Quartz Crystal
The pulse generator for the minute/second interrupt operates from an internal 64 Hz clock and generates a
1
pulse of ⁄64 seconds in duration.

7.13.2 INTA/B pulse shortening
If the MSF flag (register Control_2) is cleared before the end of the INTA/B pulse, then the INTA/B pulse is
shortened. This allows the source of a system interrupt to be cleared immediately when it is serviced, that is, the
system does not have to wait for the completion of the pulse before continuing; see Figure 18. Instructions for
clearing the bit MSF can be found in Section 7.11.5.

The timing shown for clearing bit MSF is also valid for the non-pulsed interrupt mode, that is, when TI_TP is logic 0, where
the INTA/B pulse may be shortened by setting both bits MI and SI logic 0.
Figure 18. Example of shortening the INTA/B pulse by clearing the MSF flag

7.13.3 Watchdog timer interrupts
The generation of interrupts from the watchdog timer is controlled using the WD_CD bit (register
Watchdg_tim_ctl). The interrupt is generated as an active signal which follows the status of the watchdog timer
flag WDTF (register Control_2) if not masked. No pulse generation is possible for watchdog timer interrupts.
The interrupt is cleared when the flag WDTF is reset. Instructions for clearing it can be found in Section 7.11.5.

7.13.4 Alarm interrupts
Generation of interrupts from the alarm function is controlled by the bit AIE (register Control_2). If AIE is
enabled, the INTA/B pin follows the status of bit AF (register Control_2) if not masked. Clearing AF immediately
clears INTA/B. No pulse generation is possible for alarm interrupts.

7.13.5 Timestamp interrupts
Interrupt generation from the timestamp function is controlled using the TSIE1-4 bit (register Control_5). If
TSIE1-4 is enabled, the INTA/B pin follows the status of the flags TSF1/2/3/4, if not masked. Clearing the flags
TSFx immediately clears INTA/B. No pulse generation is possible for timestamp interrupts.

7.13.6 Battery switch-over interrupts
Generation of interrupts from the battery switch-over is controlled by the BIE bit (register Control_3). If BIE is
enabled, the INTA/B pin follows the status of bit BF in register Control_3 if not masked(see Table 78). Clearing
BF immediately clears INTA/B. No pulse generation is possible for battery switch-over interrupts.

7.13.7 Battery low detection interrupts
Generation of interrupts from the battery low detection is controlled by the BLIE bit (register Control_3). If BLIE
is enabled, the INTA/B pin follows the status of bit BLF (register Control_3) if not masked. The interrupt is
cleared when the battery is replaced (BLF is logic 0) or when bit BLIE is disabled (BLIE is logic 0). BLF is read
only and therefore cannot be cleared by command.

Figure 20. CPR and STOP bit functional diagram

The stop signal blocks the 8.192 kHz clock from generating system clocks and freezes the time. In this state,
the prescaler can be cleared with the CPR command in the Resets register.
Remark: The CLKOUT output of clock frequencies is not affected.
The time circuits can then be set and do not increment until the STOP bit is released. There is a slight chance
that STOP is set during a carry over of multiple time registers, which may have been executed incomplete.
Therefore, time must be set before clearing STOP to maintain time integrity.
2

The stop acts on the 8.192 kHz signal. Because the I C-bus or TS pin input is asynchronous to the crystal
oscillator, the accuracy of restarting the time circuits is between zero and one 8.192 kHz cycle (see Figure 21).

7.15.1.1 Data transmission
The chip enable signal is used to identify the transmitted data. Each data transfer is a whole byte, with the Most
Significant Bit (MSB) sent first.
The transmission is controlled by the active LOW chip enable signal SDA/CE. The first byte transmitted is the
command byte. Subsequent bytes are either data to be written or data to be read (see Figure 24).

7.15.2 I C-bus interface
2

The I C-bus is for bidirectional, two-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two lines are a
Serial Data Line (SDA) and a Serial Clock Line (SCL). Both lines are connected to a positive supply by a pull-up
resistor. Data transfer is initiated only when the bus is not busy.

7.15.2.1 Bit transfer
One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line remains stable during the
HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control signals (see
Figure 27).

7.15.2.2 START and STOP conditions
Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW transition of the data line,
while the clock is HIGH, is defined as the START condition S. A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while
the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP condition P (see Figure 28).

7.15.2.4 Acknowledge
The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP conditions from transmitter to receiver is
unlimited. Each byte of 8 bits is followed by an acknowledge cycle.
• A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte.
• Also, a master receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte that has been clocked
out of the slave transmitter.
• The device that acknowledges must pull-down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the
SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse (set-up and hold times
must be considered).
• A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an acknowledge on the last
byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to
enable the master to generate a STOP condition.

Acknowledgment on the I C-bus is illustrated in Figure 30.

7.15.3 Bus communication and battery backup operation
To save power during battery backup operation (see Section 7.5.1), the bus interfaces are inactive. Therefore,
2
the communication via I C- or SPI-bus should be terminated before the supply of the PCF2131 is switched from
VDD to VBAT.
With I2C interface, PCF2131 terminates transaction before switching from VDD to VBAT, with SPI interface,
PCF2131 corrupts SPI write and read data when battery switchover occurs.

2

Remark: If the I C-bus communication was terminated uncontrollably, the I C-bus has to be reinitialized by
sending a STOP followed by a START after the device switched back from battery backup operation to VDD
supply operation.

Pass level (750 V for corner pins); Charged-Device Model (CDM), according to AEC Q100-011.
Pass level; latch-up testing according to AEC Q100-004 at maximum ambient temperature (Tamb(max)).
According to the store and transport requirements (see ref.[4]) the devices have to be stored at a temperature of +8 °C to +45 °C and a humidity of 25 %
to 75 %.

Note: The PCF2131 part is not guaranteed (nor characterized) above the operating range as denoted in the
data sheet. NXP recommends not to bias the PCF2131 device during reflow (for example, if using a 'coin' type
battery in the assembly). If the customer so chooses to use this assembly method, there must be the allowance
for a full \Q0 V' level power supply \Qreset' to re-enable the device. Without a proper POR, the device may
remain in an indeterminate state.

For reliable oscillator start-up and OTP refresh at power on: VDD needs to be above 1.8 V.
MAX IDD and IBAT determined by characterization.
1
Timer source clock = ⁄60 Hz, level of pins SDA/CE, SDI, and SCL is VDD or VSS.
Production tested IDDparameter.
Any load in the application driven by CLKOUT adds to this value, for example, 10 pF, Vdd = 3v3 will add 32768 Hz * 10 pF * 3.3 V = 1.1 µA.
When the device is supplied by the VBAT pin instead of the VDD pin, VDD = 0 V. The device can only start up from VDD.

The I C-bus and SPI-bus interfaces of PCF2131 are 5 V tolerant.
Tested on a sample basis.
Pin BBS is internally connected to either VDD or VBAT, see section Section 7.5.3.

The minimum SCL clock frequency is limited by the bus time-out feature which resets the serial bus interface if either the SDA or SCL is held LOW for a
minimum of 25 ms. The bus time-out feature must be disabled for DC operation.
A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to bridge the
undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
Cb is the total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage, tf is 250 ns. This allows series protection
resistors to be connected between the SDA/CE pin, the SCL pin, and the SDA/SCL bus lines without exceeding the maximum tf.
tVD;ACK is the time of the acknowledgment signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
tVD;DAT is the minimum time for valid SDA (out) data following SCL LOW.
Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes of less than 50 ns.
